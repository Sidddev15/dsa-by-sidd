# 📘 DSA by Siddharth – 90-Day Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge

Welcome! This repository is my personal space for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) using **JavaScript**.  
I'm following the [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) and supplementing it with LeetCode practice.

> 👨‍💻 Goal: Get interview-ready for product-based and remote software roles by building real coding muscle – one problem at a time!

## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

- 🧮 Problem-solving patterns (sliding window, recursion, DP)
- 📊 Time/space complexity analysis
- 👨‍🏫 Learning to write clean, readable JS code
- 🧠 Thinking in constraints and edge cases
- 🔥 Staying consistent daily despite long work hours
